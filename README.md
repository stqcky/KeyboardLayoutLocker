# KeyboardLayoutLocker
Locks your layout.

Have you ever had a problem where you accidentally switched your layout while playing a game and it messed up your controls? Probably not, but it was an issue for me.

## Usage
Right click the lock icon in your system tray and click Enable to lock your currently selected layout.
